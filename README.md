Disaster Response Pipeline ProjectProject DescriptionThis project is part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program, it aims to build a machine learning pipeline to classify disaster messages. The dataset that will be used for this project was provided by Figure Eight and contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. We’ll build a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that the messages can be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency.Finally, the project will include a web app that can be used to get the classification results for an input new message and display visualizations of the data.InstallationPython 3.6 or above should be used, you’ll need to install the following libraries:1.	numpy2.	pandas3.	sklearn4.	sqlalchemy5.	flask6.	plotly7.	pickle8.	sys9.	reFile Descriptionsapp| - template| |- master.html  # main page of web app| |- go.html  # classification result page of web app|- run.py  # Flask file that runs app- data|- disaster_categories.csv  # data to process |- disaster_messages.csv  # data to process|- process_data.py # ETL Pipeline script|- InsertDatabaseName.db   # database to save clean data to- models|- train_classifier.py # ML Pipeline script|- classifier.pkl  # saved model - README.mdInstructions1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database        python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves        python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. 	python run.py3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/Screenshots
